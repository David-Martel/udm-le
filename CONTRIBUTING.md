## Contributing

Thanks for wanting to contribute! If you'd like to propose a feature by all means open a feature request and if it's something myself, or someone else would like to hack together, you might get lucky.

If you're a do it yourself kind of person, feel free to open a pull request and outline what you're trying to accomplish and I'll be happy to review it as soon as I can.
